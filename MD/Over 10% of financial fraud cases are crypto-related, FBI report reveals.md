### Key Takeaways * Crypto fraud in 2023 led to a 45% increase in losses
compared to 2022. * Victims over 60 were the most affected, with losses near
$1.6 billion. Share this article ![Follow on Google
News](https://static.cryptobriefing.com/wp-
content/uploads/2024/04/05153217/follow-us-on-google-news.png) The Federal
Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center has released its
[Cryptocurrency Fraud Report for
2023](https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3CryptocurrencyReport.pdf)
, revealing a significant surge in losses due to crypto-related scams. Despite
representing only 10% of total complaints received, crypto fraud accounted for
nearly half of all financial losses reported to the FBI last year. Of the
69,000 crypto-related complaints filed in 2023, individuals over 60 were the
most frequently targeted demographic, suffering losses of almost $1.6 billion.
Investment schemes dominated the fraud landscape, accounting for 71% of
reported cases, while call center fraud and government impersonation scams
made up approximately 10% of incidents. ### **Play-to-earn scams and crypto
ATMs** The FBI received complaints from over 200 countries, but the vast
majority originated in the United States. Many losses resulted from confidence
schemes, prompting the FBI to warn against trusting investment advice from
individuals never met in person. The report also highlighted the risk of labor
trafficking, where workers are lured into exploitative positions abroad, often
in call centers running “pig butchering” scams. Other fraudulent activities
threatening US citizens included play-to-earn scams and businesses falsely
claiming to recover lost crypto assets. Crypto ATMs (kiosks) emerged as a
significant vulnerability, with 5,500 cases resulting in losses exceeding $189
million. Scammers prefer these machines due to the anonymity of transactions,
using them for various schemes including customer service fraud, extortion,
and romance scams. James Barnacle, deputy assistant director of the FBI’s
criminal investigative division, stated that chances of recovering funds lost
through crypto kiosks are “slim.” He also revealed that when notifying fraud
victims, 75% were unaware they had (already) been targeted. ### **Security and
regulation** The report underscores the growing sophistication of crypto-
related fraud and the need for increased public awareness. As digital assets
become more mainstream, scammers are adapting their tactics to exploit
vulnerabilities in the ecosystem and prey on unsuspecting investors.

For the crypto industry, these findings highlight the urgent need for improved
security measures, enhanced user education, and stronger collaboration with
law enforcement agencies. The substantial increase in fraud cases may also
prompt regulators to scrutinize the sector more closely, potentially leading
to stricter oversight and compliance requirements for crypto firm. In related
news, a new method called “[ZERO-KYC
mechanism](https://cryptobriefing.com/p2p-crypto-security-proposal/) ” has
been proposed by a pseudonymous developer, with the aim of countering P2P
crypto scams. The FBI advises investors and users of digital assets to remain
vigilant, conduct thorough research before engaging in any crypto-related
activities, and to remain wary of unsolicited investment opportunities or
requests for personal information Recent crypto fraud related cases include
